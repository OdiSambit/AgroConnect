            <h2>About AgroConnect</h2>
            <p>In the recent past, we have read many incidents regarding the farmer suicides due to debts and poor yield from farming. For a country like India, with the rise in population, dependency over the land for building houses and industrial areas is increasing rapidly. The fertile land for farming is dwindling and more yields have to be produced to satisfy the need of the country. Even though the demand increase, the farmers are suffering from some major issues like : <br><br>

                i. Raising the initial investment for setting up the field due to high bank interest. <br><br>
                
                ii. Fetch reasonable prices for their produce due to the intervention of middlemen in market. <br><br>
                
                iii. Analyzing market trends and customer needs. Currently the farmer and customer are completely separated in the market by the middlemen. <br><br>
                
                iv. Inefficient supply chain and issues in storage and transportation, leading to deterioration of crops. <br><br>
                
                Similarly, the customers are also worried about the high price of commodities as well as the quality of produce. They are forced to purchase whatever is available in the market at the price set by the seller. The ill practices of Black marketing, hoarding, adulteration, etc., carried out by the middle man further increases the prices for the farm products. Even though the demand for organic products is increasing, there is lack of mechanism for tracing the stages of organic cultivation and ensure authenticity. The biggest challenge in the agro-markets is the disconnect between the farmers and the consumers.
